### Learning Goals:
- Understand and effectively use event listeners and handlers to manipulate the DOM
- Evaluate and explore the connection between Javascript, CSS and HTML
- Work collaboratively as a team with planning, executing and utilizing a git workflow

### Wins + Challenges:
- Wins:
    - Getting the "Saved Covers Section" to work with the selected covers
    - Seeing the dynamic nature of the form in the "Make Your Own Cover" section
    - Understanding and resolving merge conflicts collaboratively
- Challenges:
    - Identifying when it was more productive to work together versus seperately whilst not jeapordizing the learning goals
